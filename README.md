# WoWS_BrighterShells
In the previous update,  there were changes made to the projectiles in the game, causing them to quickly lose their highlights after firing. This has affected the visual effects when tracking projectiles, making it difficult to observe hit points as clearly as before.

This mod allows the projectiles to maintain a bright white color throughout their trajectory and removes the textures on the existing models, aiming to recreate the experience as closely as possible to the previous version.
